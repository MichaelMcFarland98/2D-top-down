# Overview

I wanted to get to know Unity more and decided to create a 2D Top-Down video game.
Some of the scripts and animations have been uploaded here. If you want to get the whole game or need help with getting some of the scripts to work, email me at michaelmcfarland1998@gmail.com. To play the game, you will use the WASD or arrow keys to move around and the space bar to swing your sword at the enemy. Below is a videoe demo of the game so far.

# Development Environment

I used some free to use assets. I will link them below. I used Unity and Visual Code to program the scripts into Unity.
